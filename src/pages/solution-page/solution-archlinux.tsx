            What is Archlinux and why should you provision it with Install Doctor?

          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Archlinux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that is known for its simplicity, elegance, and
            user-friendliness. It is designed to be fast, stable, and customizable, making it an ideal choice for users
            who want a minimalist and customizable Linux distribution. Archlinux is a rolling-release distribution,
            which means that it is constantly updated with the latest software packages.

          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            If you are provisioning Archlinux, you would want to do it properly with an installation framework like
            Install Doctor. This is because the installation process for any operating system can be time-consuming and
            complex, especially if you are provisioning multiple systems. An installation framework like Install Doctor
            can automate many of the tasks involved in installing and configuring the operating system, making the
            process faster and more efficient.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Install Doctor is regularly tested on Archlinux, which means that it is designed to work seamlessly with the
            operating system. It also handles many of the Archlinux specific issues that people face while provisioning
            Archlinux, such as package dependencies and kernel modules. This means that you can be confident that the
            installation process will be smooth and reliable, without any compatibility issues or other problems.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph class="quote-summary">
            Moreover, with Install Doctor, you can keep your configurations in YAML format saved to a git repository.
            This allows you to version control your configurations and easily track changes over time. It also makes it
            easier to share configurations between systems or with other users. This feature can save you time and
            effort by making it easier to maintain and manage your Archlinux installations.

            In conclusion, Archlinux is a lightweight and customizable Linux distribution that is known for its
