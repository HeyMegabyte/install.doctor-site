authorDescription: Hey, my name is Brian. My friends call me BZ. I am the main driving force behind Megabyte Labs and its various offerings. Apart from optimizing my developer tool stack, my hobbies include going to the gym, partying with friends, and playing volleyball / kickball. I never turn down a conversation about AI, God, time travelers, or Jesus. I frequently think about how I can make the world a better place by inspiring others.

If you want an efficient development team, you should make it as easy as possible for your developers to develop. One way you can do this is by packaging pre-made operating systems, complete with all the bells and whistles so your developers do not have to fuss over things like `adb` missing from the `PATH`. Our Self-Service Portal addresses this issue by integrating with your cloud provider so that your team can access fully-configured environments, optimized for working with your codebase at will.
