description: Hey, my name is Brian. My friends call me BZ. I am the main driving force behind Megabyte Labs and its various offerings. Apart from optimizing my developer tool stack, my hobbies include going to the gym, partying with friends, and playing volleyball / kickball. I never turn down a conversation about AI, God, time travelers, or Jesus. I frequently think about how I can make the world a better place by inspiring others.

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a key feature in many enterprises. With it, you can protect all your web services by leveraging authentication methods that are already integrated into your code landscape or freely available from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter. Install Doctor paves the way from integrating SSO into your devices by making it incredibly easy to integrate SSO solutions like [CloudFlare Teams](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) and [Ory.sh](https://www.ory.sh/).

## Coming soon..
